## Welcome, Developer!

You've been tasked with helping Digital Velocity bring a fresh collection page and a functional cart drawer to life. Your goal is to build these features from scratch, incorporating a structure for styling, JavaScript, and HTML that best suits your development style and approach.

The purpose of this exercise isn't to complete everything but rather to demonstrate your thought process, coding practices, and overall implementation skills. You're free to spend as much or as little time on it as you're comfortable with.

### Challange

1. #### Collection Page

    Build a Collection Page that displays a grid of products, styled and structured to match the design specifications.

2. #### Cart Drawer

    Implement a Cart Drawer that slides out and allows users to view and manage their cart seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To get started follow the setup steps below:

1. Fork this repository and navigate into the project directory.
2. Run the following commands:

```
shopify theme push --store=velocity-tech-test --password=shptka_ea1e90de841c7cdaeb2ce101dd28caa6
shopify theme list (find the theme ID for the one you just pushed)

### What We're Looking For

-   Functionality: Does your solution meet the requirements?
-   Code Quality: Is your code clean, readable, and well-organized?
-   User Experience: Is the interface intuitive and easy to use?

### Good Luck!
